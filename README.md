# 🔍 Vulnerabilities in the TCP/IP Protocol  

## 📌 Overview  
The vulnerabilities in the **TCP/IP protocols** represent a unique class of **protocol design and implementation flaws**. These weaknesses emphasize the importance of **integrating security from the beginning** rather than treating it as an afterthought.  

Studying these vulnerabilities helps in understanding:  
- The **challenges of network security**  
- The necessity of **various security measures**  

This lab provides hands-on experience with several **TCP-based attacks** to illustrate real-world network security risks.  

---

## 🏆 Lab Objectives  
In this lab, students will conduct **multiple attacks on TCP**, covering the following topics:  

✔️ **The TCP Protocol** – Understanding its structure and functionality  
✔️ **TCP SYN Flood Attack** – Exploring denial-of-service (DoS) techniques and **SYN cookies** as a defense mechanism  
✔️ **TCP Reset Attack** – Disrupting established connections by injecting forged TCP reset packets  
✔️ **TCP Session Hijacking Attack** – Exploiting sequence number prediction to take over an active session  
✔️ **Reverse Shell** – Gaining remote control over a target system using TCP-based exploits  

🔹 **Bonus:** A **special type of TCP attack, the Mitnick attack**, is covered in a separate lab.

🚀 **By completing this lab, students will gain critical insights into TCP/IP security flaws and the importance of implementing robust security measures in network protocols.**
