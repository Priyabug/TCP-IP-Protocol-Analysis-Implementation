# 🔍 TCP-IP Protocol Analysis Implementation  

## 📌 Overview  
The **TCP/IP protocols** represent a unique class of **protocol design and implementation flaws**. These weaknesses emphasize the importance of **integrating security from the beginning** rather than treating it as an afterthought.  

Studying these protocols helps in understanding:  
- The **challenges of network security**  
- The necessity of **various security measures**  

This lab provides hands-on experience with several **TCP/IP** to illustrate real-world network infrastructure.

## 🏆 Lab Objectives  
In this lab, students will conduct **multiple attacks on TCP**, covering the following topics:  

✔️ **The TCP Protocol** – Understanding its structure and functionality  
✔️ **TCP SYN Flood** – Exploring denial-of-service (DoS) techniques and **SYN cookies** as a defense mechanism  
✔️ **TCP Reset** – Disrupting established connections by injecting forged TCP reset packets  
✔️ **TCP Session** – Exploiting sequence number prediction to take over an active session  
✔️ **Reverse Shell** – Gaining remote control over a target system using TCP-based exploits
