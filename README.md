<h1>Vulnerabilities in the TCP/IP Protocol</h1>

<body>
    <p>
        The vulnerabilities in the TCP/IP protocols represent a special genre of vulnerabilities in protocol designs and implementations; they provide an invaluable lesson as to why security should be designed in from the beginning, rather than being added as an afterthought. Moreover, studying these vulnerabilities help students understand the challenges of network security and why many network security measures are needed.

    <p>
        In this lab, students will conduct several attacks on TCP. This lab covers the following topics:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The TCP protocol</li>
        <li>TCP SYN flood attack, and SYN cookies</li>
        <li>TCP reset attack</li>
        <li>TCP session hijacking attack</li>
        <li>Reverse shell</li>
        <li>A special type of TCP attack, the Mitnick attack, is covered in a separate lab.</li>
    </ul>
